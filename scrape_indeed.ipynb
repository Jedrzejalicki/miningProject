      "This is a great fit for a recent college graduate.  The company invests in your training and professional development and creates a clear career path.  However, you are expected to put in 50 hours a week - 40 hours to fulfill your contract responsibilities and another 5 - 10 to contribute to the growth of Deloitte.  As a seasoned health care professional with 25+years of experience, the corporate culture was not a good fit.  I was interested in developing my professional skills but not necessarily in becoming a managing director and engaging in business development.  The specialist track is not as valued at Deloitte as ambition for becoming a managing director or partner.  Specialist Master\n",

Salary is a bit low if you're in the Analyst to Senior Consultant range, but Deloitte has been doing a lot to raise our salaries to help retain talent. WLB is amazing on most federal projects. My manager was a gem who was great at communicating, and it was very clear what I needed to do to receive positive feedback. Required firm initiatives are a huge pain though, which is a big gripe. GPS Deloitte also requires you to disclose all of your investments, and restricts certain types of investments like cryptocurrency. This was a big downside for me. Analyst\n",

It turns out my boss was just trying to make himself look good. When I showed a mastery of the basic skills, he put me up for a promotion to a different team that I did not want, nor that would fit around my personal life. When my health started to suffer, I asked to be transferred back. He told me it would look bad if I were to do so. I had to bring up my poor health as a reason, which I should not have had to in the first place.I ended up then being transferred as a relief employee when other teams' workloads were too much. Towards the end, I got placed with a super awesome team, but only had them for a month. In the end, I worked two extra days and found out I had been laid off. The days were compensated, but again, lack of communication was a problem.The first set of managers were extremely hard to deal with. They were very unorganized and would notify you of changes last minute and expect you to be okay with them. It was hard to plan anything. The 2nd team lead I had was very unprofessional and kept telling me to work past the time I got off. This team lead also loved to throw extra work at me and expect me to get it done same day. They wrote nasty emails if you didn't get it done or tried to explain to them you were finishing up work from the previous day. If you learn new skills, they will not  compensate you for it. If you help the team out, the supervisor and team lead basically disappear and expect you to take on Case Manager\n",

      "The culture at Deloitte is based on \"making the paper\" the rest of the talk is just dressing to promotes its image.  When the rubber hits the road no matter how altruistic, collaborative, ethical and productive you are, unless you are generating revenue you are cost to be assessed.There is a caste system.  Partners Principals and Managing Directors in the client-facing side. Commerical (Legacy) is held in higher regard than Public Sector.

      "Deloitte is recognized as one the big four firms with a great reputation, however the company falls short of wanting to retain their talent. There are more cons than pros. You are expected to travel staying in hotels more than your home which is taxing on anyone who has a family making you a part -time parent and spouse at best. When you raise your concerns to your leadership team they pretend to care and make you feel like you should be grateful to be working for Deloitte as oppose to working with you. You will have constant travel along with tedious unrelated tasks to your job and no admin time to get assigned tasks completed. There are no bonuses offered to field consultants only managers which is disappointing considering all of the hours you put in for your client, yet the company sends out Regular updates on how they’re performing well in sales year over year growing their business. Seeing that Deloitte is doing so well and the team is not reaping any of those benefits is disappointing. You will get a salary of 50K with all the unreasonable demands that will have you question if you want to keep your job or your family this is a terrible feeling. At the salary being offered you can find that anywhere these days without any travel. Considering the job market now I would hope Deloitte starts listening to their employees to make positive changes otherwise they will be know as revolving door of talent who burnout every 6 months and looking for replacements constantly.

I was once on a client where we did not hit the 55 hour minimum for busy season. Because I was only charging 45 hours a week, HR assigned 10 hours a week to a completely unrelated client.

Pay is sub-par compared to industry for my field, whilst the work-life balance isn't great (don't expect a 9 to 5). Once you get to SM level, the promotion process is very obscure, and it's not clear how to get promoted. The work isn't that interesting, and you'll often find yourself doing the same things - usually the budget doesn't allow for things to be done differently, just to churn things out.Good points is that they are flexible in terms of where you work (i.e. you can work from home).

      "Deloitte is intense. Onboarding is horrendous, both to the firm and each project. Good thing is teams form around projects, so you can choose what you want to work on and interview for it. Success is largely dependent on networking skills and the reputation you build for yourself. Learning opportunities abound, and the culture is supportive of well being and work life balance only if it doesn’t interfere with client work. If the client aka manager-with-no-boundaries wants something predawn or on the weekend, the expectation is that you hop to. There are truly meaningful projects to do, but they are rarely given the attention they deserve because the goal is to charge maximum fees in minimum time. Therefore, you will be pushed towards out-of-the-box solutions (Salesforce) and if you DO get a project with room to customize or explore, the timeline is nearly always insane and you will have to cut major corners to meet the arbitrary deadlines. The pay isn’t enough for anyone who wants a life, but it’s a great first job for the hazing experience. It will toughen you up. Just get out before you become a consultant drone who talks fast in acronyms and whips out meaningless PowerPoint decks that say a lot and deliver nothing.  Senior Consultant\n",

Its pretty hard to move around to different projects or business line, especially if you are in the USDC vs Deloitte Core. The culture is work, work, work. Most people are overworked and on multiple projects so its hard getting inn contact with them to ask the simplest question. The other half of people pretends to be busy all the time to avoid work, even leadership. There is alot of Indians so expect a cultural shift if you're not used to working with alot of Indians. The benefits are great. You get a work phone, work laptop, company card for expenses, and a bunch of other perks of working for a Big4. Sr Solutions Engineer\n",
      "I worked for Deloitte for over 4 years. Here is what you need to know about Deloitte:If you are looking to get experience and want various hands on opportunities in different technologies, this is a great place to start your career... But for those who have experience, You will ONLY get your title and compensation in the hiring processes. Do not look for it in raises or \"promotions\" . This is a place to get your experience and GET OUT.. Two years tops, then look for something else. Do NOT let Deloitte try and tell you you are part of the this or that, \"build your brand\" and try and lead you into staying. They will tell you how pivotal you are to the company, then when year end comes they try and give you the least amount possible.After seeing a young coworker become senior over me with only a quarter of the tenure I had, none of the certifications, and I was expected to teach her infrastructure, I had to make a decision and look else where. I understood what was going on. I did not fit into their DEI vision.In closing, get your experience, get your certifications, make Deloitte pay for them, and find another company. that is the best advise I can give you.. Dont waste your time like I did and many others did thinking you are apart of the culture or let them tell you you are valued. because take it from me, once you show them you got another higher offer somewhere else, they will toss you aside and not entertain matching it to keep you. You are replaceable here, if you keep that in mind you will have the right mind set for the company. Consultant\n",

Projects are not well-planned in advance and may not even suit your skillet, but management expects you to complete the work somehow, with little-to-no guidance. If you don't do well on a project, they tend to blame/gaslight you. There are no real promotions or ways to move up. They may bump your pay or give you a small bonus, but it's harder to get an actual promotion. You are judged more on data and performance analytics than actual skill or talent, which causes many people to end up leaving despite the so-called *perks* and benefits. They collect so much information on you as an employee that it can feel like you're an experiment or lab rat, especially when they keep changing the system they use to decide if you are performing well at your job.

      "I have been working at ey for under a year and I have not enjoyed one minute of it. Firstly, when I was hired I was told that my salary was nonnegotiable which I later found out was a lie from colleagues who were hired. When you are first hired they will make it seem like you are in control of your career and that you have flexibility to work on multiple different engagements that will benefit your career, that is not true at all. If you are not on a project, your experience manager will pressure you to get on a project, regardless of if it has anything to do with your previous experience or interests. I think most of this stems from the experience managers not knowing about what the different engagements actually entail. I have had various conversations with the experience managers and they literally have no idea of the certifications that I hold or the experience that I have, which doesn’t make sense considering the fact that they determine which project you should be assigned to. The culture at ey sucks, managers have this idea that they can use the staff as they please and pretty much assign any task to you. When you are assigned to a project as a staff or senior staff you don’t get assigned a specified set of tasks, you are pretty much there to do whatever the manager tells you to. This is unfair because there is no limit on what is right and wrong. I literally have had managers tell me to lie, and do things that I was completely uncomfortable doing.

      "Don't do it. During my time at EY they did not recognize non-accounting-related credentials. EY views their employees as either long-term or industry hires; where industry hires are experienced persons incorporated from the field. Thus, unless you are an Accountant (or a related profession) then from a sociopolitical perspective, you are a second-class employee. Also, despite the array of service areas within EY, employees don't have the flexibility to choose to work in areas of the business that best aligns with their background.

Sure that is impatient, but there isn’t much that is keeping people through busy season without an immediate incentive to do so. Stop alienating people in the name of DEI, listen to your people, follow actual science and not politically expedient science, and reward current employees instead of hunting down new ones all the time.

I've been in 3 different contracts here  EY is still in build mode, with the \"any contract is better than no contract\" mentality, meaning partners want to make sure they keep the contract even if it means having people work overtime but not billing those hours to the government. They staff projects with recent college hires, have only 1-2 hires with relevant experience and accept any work that requires a 5 FTE count with experience (this is in tech anyway) but staff them with 1 person with experience and 5 with no experience. Run away from here. There are better companies with better projects if you have technical skills.

I enjoyed my time with EY and parlayed my five-year career in public accounting to a corporate leadership role that has quickly bridged the gap in the work/life/compensation balance that I gave up during my time in audit. Assurance Senior\n",
      "My review may not align with other reviews, but I find myself in a role that has no advancement. There are positions at EY that have no path forward and management is aware. I would leave, but the benefits are very good. Unlimited PTO and remote work to name a few.  Staff Accountant\n",
      "I loved my co-workers and the people I supported. The benefits were great. I felt like the salary was below average compared to other executive assistant roles.

My main issue was there wasn't any clear way to stand out and get promoted. Career growth was murky territory.  Executive Assistant\n",
      "After the initial training period, your work schedule is more flexible, as long as deadlines are met each month. The first couple weeks of the month are the most hectic and can easily become 70 to 80+ hour weeks, since most deadlines are set to mid-month. The last couple of weeks of the month are more relaxed, as there are mainly only maintenance tasks left in preparation for the next month. You get all of the support that you need from your seniors, trainers, and other coworkers, as everyone works in conjunction as a team. After two years, you have the option of diagonal movement into other departments if you so wish.  Sales Tax Accountant\n",
      "Overall, EY in general deserves five stars. That being said, as one steps down the ladder to the middle management area of EY, things can get a little dicey on a routine basis e.g. lack of adequate headcount, lack of meaningful upward communication, and overall, top leadership's understanding of the non-client facing operational side of the business.

You learn a lot really quick and learn valuable skills that can translate to other jobs. Promotions are guaranteed if you are average or above. Cons: A typical day involves getting done with as much stuff you can. It's a constant deadline you & the team are chasing. I have found that most all teams are understaffed. This past busy season lasted from Jan thru May for me. I had co-workers my level (staff & senior) in busy season until July. Managers work busy season hours almost year round.

Managers will conference with you about your goals and plans, personal and professional alike, and take steps to help you accomplish them.Definitely would recommend this as a great starting position for those interested in admin work for a large, well-known firm.

You are surrounded by highly motivated individuals who are willing to work hard and do long hours for 6+ months out of the year. Working together with seniors and managers who are in their 20s definitely make the EY experience rewarding.

      "Your experience depends significantly on where you work, what you do, and who you work with. My experience was largely negative. Pigeon-holed into a team that developed my skills in only a narrow niche, leaving me with little \"portable skills\" to take elsewhere. Required to work insane hours to the point that I would often get only 3-4 hours of sleep per night. Unfortunately my EY experience was a good example of how an employer can abuse its employees without any negative repercussion on the employer, because it simply weeds out the employees who can't take the abuse and is left with those who are able to tolerate it and focus 100% of their time on work, leaving no time for personal/family life. As I said, your mileage may vary. I am sure some EY employees have very different and much more positive experiences, but be forewarned that in general this is a company that is concerned only with making money and not with the welfare of their employees. EY is hardly unique in that regard, but that doesn't mean it should be excused for treating employees in this manner. Accountant\n",

Generally, managers and higher are extremely willing to teach and help staff/seniors grow. EY invests in its employees in training but they expect you to work a lot of hours. You'll learn a ton and get great experience. Benefits are mid-tier compared to industry. Nothing to write home about but also do not stand out as worse than the norm. Tax Senior\n",

      "Typical big 4 accounting - long hours for portions of the year and high stress. Especially in a smaller market, it can drag on a lot as smaller private jobs never bit their deadlines. I’ve learned a lot and worked with great people but easy to burn out  Assurance Staff\n",
      "The interview process was incredibly easy and getting started didn’t take long. I worked here for about 2 years and went in with no experience so they provide training. Training is essentially throwing you into a situation and seeing if you sink or swim. Employees are always on call and expected to be available. I was full time but when covid hit, my hours were cut in half which meant paychecks were tiny. I made too much to receive unemployment, but too little to actually pay my bills. Pre-Covid employees were burnt out. Analyst\n",

      "While I love the culture and work and the exposure to smart people, the life as an auditor has gone downhill. Booming job market means high turnover and much more work. Good people are getting burned out and quitting and partners do not seem to care much since their margins are just going up. Rotten compensation system where you get to do the work of 2 people when someone quits but do not get compensated for it all as the comp is so structured. So regardless if you are a superstar or suck - you are pretty much paid the same. Assurance Manager\n",
      "Working at E&Y was one of the best career choices I made. You work with the best of the best, the smartest folks in industry. Everyone was an \"A\" student otherwise you would not be there.

      "I loved my co-workers and the people I supported. The benefits were great. I felt like the salary was below average compared to other executive assistant roles. The work life balance wasn't as practiced as I would've liked and they would assign you more people even if you didn't have the capacity (in some cases, not valid for every single EA). My main issue was there wasn't any clear way to stand out and get promoted. Career growth was murky territory.  Executive Assistant\n",

      "I was on the consulting side. EY or any big 4 has great benefits and compensation but you will work for it. There is little work life balance. Many time they expect you to work 16 hour days. Sometimes I felt like majority of my job was creating PowerPoints. They give you unlimited PTO but don't worry you will never have time to take it. May care about D&I internally but many times they accept clients that do not. Its hard because you work for EY but really you work for the Client. Sometimes you wonder why different clients are accepted. For example although EY is inclusive you may work for a client who publicly does not support a certain group of people and you wonder...  Senior Consultant\n",
      "Great environment with a good colleague but the work is so stressBut In EY, I learn a lot experience as well as the attitude of my colleague.Very much want to continue to work Auditor\n",
      "Like the other Big 4 public accounting firms, EY is a great place for a budding accountant fresh out of college to start their careers. You can gain exposure to a large number of industries and clients, each facing their own unique issues that EY has to help resolve. There are a ton of great resources to learn from; there literally seems to be an expert in every possible aspect of accounting working at the firm. The company's management is also very supportive of workplace flexibility, although this mindset varies from team to team. However, working here is definitely not without its faults. As a client serving organization, expectations are set extremely high for employees and there is always a deadline to meet, often times conflicting. Busy seasons are brutal and just when you think it's all over, another client might be facing a new issue and you're working on a new deadline again. Things come up all the time and you always feel on call 24/7. There is a definite feeling of a lack of work-life separation and that can really wear on you over time. While most people are very supportive here and want to help you succeed in your careers as it makes their lives easier the better you are at your job as well, there will also be times when you don't see eye to eye with a fellow colleague and still be forced to work together on a project. You won't always get along with everyone you work with and you can't choose who you get to work with either. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect, you can't even pick your projects most of the time. Project assignments are distributed based on Senior Associate\n",

      "Upon joining EY, I was hired for a different role than the one I am in currently. While I found my initial role fulfilling in the beginning, I was looking for more challenges and realized that in-order for my career to advance the way I wanted to was if I moved over to a client facing position within the firm. Through extensive internal networking and internal support, EY leadership was gracious enough to not only allow me the opportunity to interview for the group I was interested in but also made a huge exception for me to join after interviewing. It is a true testament to their commitment for their employees professional and personal growth. I could not be more thankful to work at such a great firm.

Some of the older guys were good people, stuck in a mediocre job that paid just enough to keep them but not enough to make their lives good. Compared to other hourly gigs the rates weren’t bad but they were treating employees like contractors and constantly changing the terms of employment by using 3rd party hr companies as fronts and cancelling and forcing the redefining of work contracts to remove benefits. Super sketchy director, reminded me a lot of the boss from that animatronic TV show, the dinosaurs. Free food on the reg was the best benefit they had going for them.  Financial Planner\n",

Yes, there is flexibility in terms of when you start and end your day and as you move higher up the ranks, no one will question where you are and what you are doing, but there is an expectation that you will get your work done. And it will be more work than you ever thought possible.The firm's management seems to have taken a dive. There was a time when I trusted that management was making the right decisions, but in the past several years, I felt less and less like they had a strategic path that made sense. Audit Senior Manager\n",
      "Very much what you can expect from Big 4 consulting. You will work very hard, long hours, under very high expectations, for a wide variety of leaders that can be both good and bad, in the hopes of being promoted. And, in the end, your performance reviews and career progression/success opportunities will come down to only 2 basic \"metrics\". So focus intently on those 2. Partner/Principle is the pinnacle goal; you will need to be progressing to that level or you will be worked out of the organization over time. Keep in mind that in reality very very few ever make it to Partner/Principle. Most attain this through a ladder of movements between firms. Everyone else is busting it and selling, selling, selling. If you are willing to put in a ton of hours, work on a variety of projects, do whatever it takes to create and maintain positive impressions from at least 5-10 Partners who will go to bat for you, then you can make it.

      "I took a dat associate role at pwc expecting to be working with the technicals of Erp systems. They really made the role seem more technical then it was you do not touch any tech or code in this role. The entire role is looking at soc 1 and soc2 reports. This involves looking at the prior year evidence / documentation and copying it over for the current year with new names dates and evidence. The evidence comes in from kpi reports and your job is  confirming the names and dates match what was requested which is most likely the same thing that was requested last year. The control c control v meme about this role is real. I felt like the job was very tedious and boring. However if you’re an accountant with a accounting degree who wants to dip there toes in the water of tech I think this could be a great role for you. This is a it-AUDIT role emphasize on the audit because you do not touch the it side at all. If your a techie stay away go devops cyber or tech consultanting don’t fall for the same trap I did. I plan on moving out of this role very soon despite its benefits due to the banality of the work. Now if you want a easy work life balance light travel and don’t care about being a excel monkey this could be a good role. Realistically you work 40 hours a week and 55 hours during busy season for easy work and pretty good pay. The benefits are great medical dental and even legal plans they offer are fantastic. This work will definitely not stress you out you are literally just following steps from last year or that are already laid out.

But, consultants have substantially more opportunity to earn promotions. Many Businesses Services employees and consultants are extremely underpaid for what the market bears right now and as a result, the firm is hemorrhaging people.

Most of the audit new hires are frustrated and unhappy with the the compensation and workload. It is a very different experience than when I was an intern at the beginning of 2020. PwC has been getting by because of their name but they need to focus on rewarding and keeping their current employees because the staff turnover is insanely high (even for big 4 firms).

      "Early on I enjoyed my time with PwC, the rose tinted glasses wear off eventually however and the reality is that the culture will work you to the bone. Weekends and evenings are a consistent expectation. Lots of the sayings which are parroted are not often followed. \"We're not performing brain-surgery.\"\"No one dies if we don't complete an audit\" You're going to work that weekend to get the workpaper onto the manager's desk by Monday. Believe you me buddeh. The fact of the matter is, stressed out people stress out other people. Perhaps its an inevitability. There is constant name changes for simple programs which makes it difficult to keep up with the language of the company. There is a substantial amount of bloat software which wears down the computers and clogs the system. Even though the company is supposed to be \"tech-enabled\" it's more of an afterthought. Most of the tools employed are unnecessary to an audit, but rather an lukewarm attempt to stay modern. The expectations shift from team to team, consistency is not an valued concept with PwC. The type of work and the quality of the audit can shift constantly.Overall, I wouldn't go back unless it was a life or death situation.

I have been here seven years and worked across various teams. I have never worked for a more disorganized and schizophrenic organization that overlooks and overworks top tier talent while promoting mediocrity. Not sure how Accenture gets so many awards for Top Workplace or Diversity because it certainly does not live up to these values or aspirations once inside the company. The “truly human” HR slogan is a farce. People who have dedicated their entire career and sacrificed their personal lives for this company are overworked and depleted and then treated like a pariah when they burn out or ask for help.

Advancement is not guaranteed even if you work hard and put in a ton of OT. I’ve been overworked to a point where I couldn’t sleep and experienced depression. Meanwhile I know people that started with me and have the same experience and they can take naps at work but still get promoted. Pay increases and promotions depend on whether or not your manager will advocate for you not based on the how hard you work. The company has a good vision and could be great if they paid market value and promoted the employees who work hard and want to make a difference.  Software Test Engineer Analyst \n",
      "The work varies by project, but mine can get quite repetitive once you get used to it. The pros of the company is that they are usually not hesitant in paying out compensation for work on Holidays if labor is insufficient.The overall company culture implemented is quite good, as there are multiple initiatives launched to support company-wide employees.However, it falls short when it comes to individual projects. Accenture leadership have not been too pro-active when it comes to diagnosing problems within individual projects.For our project, there are several problems.Management can be slow to address updates. Whether internal company updates or project updates, floor analysts are sometimes notified at the last minute. Attrition rate. Granted that different projects have different circumstances, the turnover rate is pretty high considering the amount of people within the project.I've not seen any steps taken to address the issue to lower attrition rate, even for well-performing individuals.

      "Accenture has much to offer in breadth - so much to learn especially new tech /digital, new innovative acquisitions. Leader selection has improved with stronger focus on people leadership. Biggest concern is leveling and career paths for experienced hires. Experienced hires with 15-20+ Vp/C-Level prior roles leveled with 6/7 yrs Accenture only experience is nonsensical. Should be a specific exp hire Role- L5 - with short path to MD or stay L5 as expert/TL, with a peer group cohort program focused to ramp gap skills quickly (with coaches) and intentionally so we gain the powerful value of real experience and credibility with Accenture skills quickly. 90% of tte leaders in my current leadership program are not happy and ready to leave. Secondly - our bonus plan is the worst I’ve seen anywhere - even banking. I was used to a minimum $50k bonus often close to $100k - here a $10-20 bonus is hard to come by for SMs. And deceptive info about the bonus in hiring. My new hire RSUs expire after this year and it doesn’t appear they extend them - my comp will take a big hit - of course I’ll leave. Tech replaces your RSUs as long as you perform and they let you know so you don’t leave. Lastly the health benefits /out of pocket cost is excessive - very expensive compared to tech and smaller consulting. We get away with this bc most talent doesn’t know any better - homegrown. I have met some great people here and learned a lot - but investment in IP is limited /we can’t compete on our methodologies/tools - it’s all ad hoc /offering development barely exists  which makes delivering quality Senior Manager, T&O\n",

Engagement Management Coordinator\n",
      "KPMG was definitely a journey. It seems like the management didn't really care what kind of projects that they took on and what that meant for employees. However, I learned more than I could have imagined, worked with some really smart people, and the benefits are great. You also get a chance to work with other large companies. Senior Associate\n",
      "You should know what to expect going in most likely.  Figure out what you want to get out of the experience going in and it will make it more bearable.  Auditor\n",
      "I mean, it's Big 4. At the staff level, the biggest attractions to get in are the possible exit opportunities when you get out. If those opportunities don't show up, then really, it's just a big white-collar factory. But for some people it works out staying in so good for them.Disclaimer: I'm strictly talking at the staff level. Senior staff\n",
      "I loved it, always felt good there, people where usually proactive, they provided resources to help employees continue to grow to help their clients achieve their goals, good team environment.  The building was beautiful.  Client locations where also amazing. Consultant\n",
      "All us secretaries and admin always took care of each other and fill in when needed.  Always celebrated all of our birthdays by going out to nice lunches at Houstons!!  Loved my time at KPMG and miss all my co-workers :) Receptionist/Administrative Assistant\n",
      "I enjoyed my time at KPMG and think it is an excellent place to begin a career in the accounting field. The management is very supportive and there is a lot of training to make sure you're up to date. International Tax Associate\n",
      "In public accounting, you learn nearly every day, however some of the work is quite tedious. The hours during busy season are typically quite intense and will require you to place you personal life on hold. Granted this is just the deal with public accounting and is not unique to KPMG. Wages are standard for public accounting but are low compared to industry positions, especially when total hours are factored in. Audit Associate\n",
      "KPMG actually values their employees, though your management, compensation, and advancement do not actively reflect it. KPMG has 2 yearly shutdowns, one over Christmas, and the other over 4th of July for a paid week that doesn't count against your vacation time. Surprisingly weak on the benefits and pay side, it is a fun company to work at. Sr. Associate\n",
      "There are plenty of opportunities to learn and advance in your career. Opportunities are boundless, but be prepared to work 50 hours every week. Things pop up often and management treats everything like a fire drill. Management bends to clients needs without thinking of the strain it puts on their employees. If you are a person who is very career focused, this will be a good place for you to learn and grow. If not, work life balance is not great and you might often feel trapped to your desk all day.  Tax Associate\n",
      "KPMG feels like a family from the very beginning. Everyone is welcoming and willing to help you succeed whether you've been there for a month or for 20 years.  Tax Intern\n",
      "KPMG doesn't have a very strong culture and limited opportunities to grow. Projects are not assigned based on skillset, and advancement in career is slow. Data Scientist\n",
      "Work life balance is practically non-existent, especially since transitioning to work from home. At this point, basically just trying to hang in there to get enough experience and leave as soon as possible just like most people.  Audit Associate\n",
      "Working in KPMG’s Deal Advisory space a can be fun and challenging. It all depends on the mindset with with you approach the task. The hours can be tough significantly impacting work life balance but if you have an awesome team you’ll very rarely feel it. The work it’s self is pretty cool; working in the space helps you see lots of different companies and get under the hood of those companies to see how they run and make money. I think it’s invaluable experience but your mileage may vary. All in all I think it’s a great place to start a career in the finance/accounting/consulting space. Deal Advisory Associate\n",
      "All the staff and managers where great but busy season sucked working 60-100 hrs per week and lots of travel. Tons of company happy hrs and events. Great place to start a career and give you the upper-hand when applying to another job.  Senior Associate Audit\n",
      "It’s a great place to start a career. Really enjoyed my peer group. The work/life balance does not exist. Definitely not compensated for the amount of overtime provided and very little flexibility. Audit Manager\n",
      "KPMG is a meat grinder.   The 12 years I worked for them I never say one person retire.   The company gets rid of its aging workforce before they get a chance to retire with full benefits.    One of the worst companies I've ever been associated with.  While there I saw every person hired on with me let go through the years.  By the time the company forced early retirement on me at the age of 57 after 12 years of dedicated service everyone I knew at the company had be let go.   Not a secure place to work for long-term life planning. Programmer\n",
      "KPMG provides an excellent place to grow your career with very generous compensation. Good amount of business lines with very good management and separation of duties. Sale Associate\n",
      "The work can vary from fairly interesting to pretty mundane, but the thing that makes KPMG what it is are the people. That is definitely the best part about working here. Besides that, it is a high stress environment with long hours. Management does try to recognize performance though.  Senior Associate\n",
      "Audit is audit buts it’s the best of the B4 in my opinion.  Career coaches are usually very helpful and care about your growth.                                                                           Associate\n",
      "Long hours and work life balance is not always great. Schedule can change week to week/month to month due to nature of job. Didn't really have any say about what project you get placed on which isn't always great if you get stuck on a client engagement you don't enjoy. Good benefits and company perks, but pay should have been more compared to industry. People are frequently overworked and burnt out. Trainings were fun and learned a lot, especially when new. Great people - made some great friends. You do learn a ton though because you're forced to so it is a great way to quickly advance your career. There is high turnover at a lot of Big 4 companies. IT Advisory Associate\n",
      "Working at KPMG was one of the most positive experiences I've had in my professional career. There was an open door policy between staff and management within my team, and the full-time KPMG workers. There didn't seem to be a hierchy among high skilled workers. Everyone maintained a culture of respect and inclusion. This was an amazing place to work. Office Support Assistant\n",
      "Fun times with initial manager but not so happy with subsequent manager. Learn alot work hard to meet engagement deliverables and quality work products Senior Associate\n",
      "Start your career there but get out quickly. Management recycle employees like water bottles. You will work hard but will not get promoted. You will get assigned in engagement based on who you know. During summer you will be scrambling to be assigned. Audit Senior Associate\n",
      "Didn't like my time in there, was a waste of time, bad management and a lot of \"you should know you could have done this\" when nobody explains anything to you Accountant\n",
      "Great place to start a career. Supportive environment which supplies the resources needed to learn and grow a career. So many opportunities especially for those that are driven.  Audit Manager\n",
      "I'm just a intern in KPMG, but my co-worker(or supervisor) told me that they have to work very late so as to complete their assigned jobs. And the payment was just not pleasant. Audit Intern\n",
      "Great people to work with in most of the teams i have been on, stable job with predictable advancement from assoc to senior to manager to senior manager, but overall too many hours and not enough pay Senior Audit Associate\n",
      "Long hours and not compensated accordingly. However people are great to work with and learning at such a high pace. Great training is made available to all employees  Manager\n",
      "Great place to get trained and build your career - tough hours but the trade off is worth it. Recommend you stay until senior associate at a minimum.  Senior Associate\n",
      "Really productive work environment. Hours can be long but only expected. Management listen to your concerns and make allowances if you ever need them. Consultant\n",
      "Great company to launchpad your company. There are numerous opportunities you can dive into or transfer into once you're in. Just do your part in selling yourself well. Technology Assurance Associate\n",
      "Overall, a great place to be if you want your career to accelerate in high gear. That said, hours can be long, travel can be intense, and the advancement opportunities do create a competitive environment . Director\n",
      "Management consulting not in focus, hence little motivation to work there, as silos mentality creates road blocker in own development within the consulting department. Senior Associate\n",
      "Despite National being very pro mental health and inclusive, I found the local office to be quite the opposite.  I have never been treated so poorly by a professional then I was at KPMG. My direct manager was unavailable and unwilling to listen or appreciate mental health concerns. No support offered which is really disappointing for the level of company.  Just a number not a person. Senior Manager\n",
      "This is the typical big 4 experience. Long hours but worth your while at the beginning of your career.  You will learn a lot but you will get exhausted. Tax Preparer\n",
      "The firm does not have the Ability to execute a meaningful direction and strategy.  No sense of team or market leadership.  Partners have no interest in driving the business , only how will the be bonused each year. Director\n",
      "A lot of time consuming tasks - normally performed by offshore teamsHard to get a proper in-boarding training Promotions every yearVery talented coworkers Transfer pricing\n",
      "KPMG provides an excellent place to grow your career with very generous compensation. Good amount of business lines with very good management and separation of duties. Sale Associate\n",
      "I enjoyed my time there. Many nice coworkers the work was efficient but the management team I did not care for. With the team I worked with they were for themselves and made it seem like they didn’t want to help and were annoyed easily  Tax Associate\n",
      "Interning for this company was interesting it was all online so it was tough to pick up information especially when unsure of everything going on in the first place Internship\n",
      "The role has its benefits in terms of advancement, flexible hours during the offseason and benefits. However, the compensation is very rigid in terms of not differentiating for performance, as you can expect with a large corporation. It's hit and miss in terms of the how supportive your managers and partners can be.  Senior Audit Associate\n",
      "I’ve been here 5 years now. It’s a great company no complaints. Pay is good and the work is interesting. Would recommend working here to others. The leadership is solid. Director of Sales\n",
      "Had fun as a recent undergrad and felt invested in. However, travel and unpredictable schedule was not sustainable.  Nonetheless, I learned a lot and enjoyed my time there.  Associate\n",
      "I really enjoy the jobs I am placed on and the people I work with. I think the firm does a good job advancing inclusion & diversity programs. One downfall is that I don’t feel compensated for the level of effort I put in, but they’re in the process of changing the way reviews are completed so I’m hopeful it’ll change.  Senior Associate\n",
      "This company gives you the opportunity to excel and grow depending on your position level. More potentials for staff level management than it is for admin assistants unless you have a 4-year degree and want to move into a staffing position. Admin Assistant\n",
      "Upper management is unrealistic and does not care for lower level employees, middle management is good but the great ones leave to go elsewhere, under paid for big 4. Senior Associate Advisory\n",
      "Great people, easy commute, beautiful office.  Lots of perks. Volunteer time off which you are given many choices. Also free coffee and milk supplied by the office. Executive Assistant\n",
      "Dogs are the best thing going for the company they are very fun and make the workplace much better to be in and make me want to come in everyday and never call out Dog Sitter\n",
      "Working hard from associate to senior to manager. There is a classic path to partner or you can hop out like so many do after a few years. Big clients, large engagements. Fast paced. Low pay for the hours. Associate\n",
      "Lots of training. Busy, fast paced atmosphere. Great diverse workplace where everyone was welcome. Sorry to leave there but I was laid off due to a COVID reduction in workforce. Executive Assistant\n",
      "The firm has excellent benefits, but the culture is something to desire.  If you are not an Associate or above, you will not have a voice and often left out.  They speak on Inclusion and Diversity, but the numbers does not show that.  If you are a minority your chances on succeeding are slim to none.  Please take heed to this advice and do your due diligence before applying or accepting a job with this firm. Someone other than an Associate\n",
      "Performance driven culture. Co workers are very supportive. Many opportunities to learn and good supportive managers and employees are very focused on their work. Since this is accounting, many employees work long hard hours during busy season but the company rewards well. The Short Hills office was a close-knit work culture. Executive Assistant\n",
      "Nothing special. No raise or bonus. Not much growth while working at this company. Not much support from management either. My team does have the ability to work from home which is nice.  Analyst\n",
      "Good place to start great time family at work feel as home learn alot on the job , professional team members great benefits . alot of work , great bonus,  Customer Service Representative\n",
      "I would rate them 5 out of 5 for shelling out professionals. It’s like a production line. They pay good money to train you into a problem-killing machine. BUT in my humble opinion, it’s not worth the toll on your mental health. They’ll put a straw in you, and suck the life out of you, checking to make certain you’re not dead as they do so. Colleague died and got a minute of silence. We continued typing as we stood in “silence”. I quit, met all conditions, but the final emoluments never came. Don’t do it! Experienced Analyst\n",
      "Your experience will entirely depend on your engagement and/or team. You can be put on an absolute dumpster fire of a project and have a dreadful experience, or you can get put on an excellent project and end up wondering why some of your peers are so stressed and contemplating jumping off a bridge. I was fortunate to be put on a great project and have had an excellent experience thus far. Oth I have heard a couple of my fellow new hires have been put on terrible projects and I genuinely feel bad for them. The concerns i’ve heard are incompetent managers, Senior Associate with little to no accountability for the success of their new associates, and unusually long hours. Overall my experience has been a super positive one.  Associate\n",
      "Pros: Diversity, Technology, can work remote, health benefits + pto (day after thanksgiving off + closed christmas week), everyone at every level is issued a firm laptopCons: low pay for a global firm/no annual bonus, micro-managing, too much emphasize on client coding, no training on their systems or new technology they implement, no effort on bringing the group together as a team   Executive Assistant\n",
      "1) Most days are very busy as you scale up in the organization and involve many hours of calls, work, review and deliverables.2) You learn the technical aspects, such as tax, on the go if you didn't have prior knowledge of the subject matter. There are great training opportunities but these are typically left to certain times of the year.3) The culture is intense, but people are generally very nice and its diverse. However, the time commitment is almost a given and crazy hour weeks are almost expected.4) The Hardest part of my job is hashing out some of the technical aspects of certain exercises or projects, combined with meeting tight deadlines and often having to redo work because of information changes.5) The most enjoyable part of my job are the colleagues and clients, generally. State and Local Tax Manager\n"
